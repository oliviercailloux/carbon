\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In \cref{sec:alts} we describe the decision space: the alternatives that we consider. To conceive this we got inspired by initiatives currently used or proposed in various research laboratories, and by the economics literature. In \cref{sec:analysis} we describe aspects that can be used to decide among alternatives (strengths and weaknesses, circumstances in which some alternatives are infeasible or of low value, …).

\section{Loose}
a tax puts a price on carbon in order to reduce emis-
sions, while a cap puts a limit on the quantity of emissions allowed, thus imputing a price.

Policy design considerations associated with implementing carbon taxes
include determining the tax base, which sectors to tax, where to set the tax rate, how to use tax
revenues, how to assess the impact on consumers and how to ensure that the tax achieves emissions
reduction goals.

critics say that carbon taxes are simply a way of raising government
revenue rather than providing environmental benefits, thus creating a tax rate that would not be econ-
omically efficient. For an efficient tax, the rate should be set equal to the marginal damage caused by
carbon emissions.

A carbon tax that rebates revenues can mitigate the impact on low-income households

taxes must be raised when reduction objective is not met (but can be politically difficult). So often prefer C and T.

Because cap and trade is often heralded as a market-based approach in the
political discourse, it is worth noting at the outset that both systems are equally market-based in
the sense that their effectiveness relies in affecting market behavior through emissions pricing.

Ady et al. 08 argue for tax rather than CaT (Cap and Trade). Tax is more economically efficient as it directly equalizes prices accross sources (not applicable for us). Also manages welfare better considering the uncertainty of abatment cost (didn’t get why). Considering redistribution effects: co² taxes are regressive. “Low-income households are more vulnerable to increases in the price of energy-intensive
goods, such as electricity, home heating fuels, and gasoline, because they spend a larger share of
their budget on these items compared with wealthier households.” CaT with free allowances also raise the profits and equity values, which benefits more the higher) income households.

\section{Literature}
For a review of
the advantages and disadvantages of an internationally harmonized carbon tax, many of which are
applicable to domestic carbon taxes, see Nordhaus (2007).

Carbon taxes: a review of experience and policy design considerations JENNY SUMNER, LORI BIRD \& HILLARY DOBOS Pages 922-943 | Published online: 15 Jun 2011 https://doi.org/10.3763/cpol.2010.0093 (Read by OC)

Aldy et al. (Aldy, J.E., Ley, E., Parry, I., 2008, ‘A tax-based approach to slowing global climate change’, National Tax Journal 61(3),
493 – 517, 10.17310/ntj.2008.3.09) discuss the design of carbon taxes
at the domestic level, suggesting that the efficient near-term tax is at least \$5 – 20 per tonne of CO 2 and
that the tax should be placed on upstream sources (Read by OC).
 
Aldy and Pizer (Aldy, J.E., Pizer, W.A., 2009, ‘Issues in designing U.S. climate change policy’, Energy Journal 30(3), 179 – 209.) summarize the litera-
ture on the distributional impacts of carbon taxes, suggesting that recycling revenue to consumers can
reduce the distributional impact.

Metcalf et al. (2008) evaluated three methods of rebating
carbon tax revenue to consumers, and found that a lump sum per capita payment of \$274 made the
carbon tax progressive.

The ultimate design of a carbon tax is subject to the political process, and is thus unlikely to match the theoretically optimal design (see del Río and Labanderia, 2009).

\section{History}
In the early 1990s, carbon taxes emerged
in northern European countries, Finland being the first nation to adopt a carbon tax in 1990. Sub-
sequently, the Netherlands (1990), Norway (1991), Sweden (1991) and Denmark (1992) implemented
carbon taxes. After a lull of almost a decade, the UK began its Climate Change Levy (CCL) in 2001. In
recent years (before 2011), several new taxes have been introduced at the provincial or municipal levels in North
America.
The US House of Representatives
passed H.R.2454 ‘The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009’ (the ‘Waxman– Markey Bill’) in
June 2009, and the US Senate introduced S.1733 ‘Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act’ (the
‘Kerry –Boxer Bill’) in September 2009. While recent federal policy has focused on carbon cap and
trade policies, Congress introduced three carbon tax bills in 2009. 1
the recently proposed French carbon tax was
designed to cover the sectors not addressed by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).
